# Basic Calculator Program

Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.



## How it works

1. User Input:

Asks the user to input two numbers and the desired mathematical operation (+, -, *, or /).
2. Conditionals for Operations:

Depending on the operation, it performs the corresponding arithmetic calculation.
Division includes a check to prevent division by zero.
3. Error Handling:

Catches invalid number inputs using try and except.
Ensures only valid operations are processed.
